# React Native Doctor

Diagnose React Native & Expo codebase health. Scans for security, performance, correctness, accessibility, and architecture issues, then outputs a 0–100 score with actionable diagnostics.

## Usage

Run this at your project root:

```bash
npx -y react-native-doctor@latest .
```

Use `--verbose` to see affected files and line numbers:

```bash
npx -y react-native-doctor@latest . --verbose
```

Use `--score` to output only the numeric score:

```bash
npx -y react-native-doctor@latest . --score
```

Use `-y` to skip prompts (required for non-interactive environments like CI or coding agents):

```bash
npx -y react-native-doctor@latest . -y
```
