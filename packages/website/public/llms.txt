# React Native Doctor

Diagnose React Native & Expo codebase health. Scans for security, performance, correctness, accessibility, and architecture issues, then outputs a 0–100 score with actionable diagnostics.

## Usage

Run this at your project root:

```bash
npx -y react-native-doc@latest .
```

Use `--verbose` to see affected files and line numbers:

```bash
npx -y react-native-doc@latest . --verbose
```

Use `--score` to output only the numeric score:

```bash
npx -y react-native-doc@latest . --score
```

Use `-y` to skip prompts (required for non-interactive environments like CI or coding agents):

```bash
npx -y react-native-doc@latest . -y
```

## Options

```

Commands:
  fix [directory]        Open Ami to auto-fix react-native-doc issues
  install-ami            Install Ami and open it to auto-fix issues
  fix-cline [directory]  Run Cline CLI to fix issues (or copy prompt for VS Code/Cline extension)
```

## Fixing issues with AI agents

After a scan, react-native-doc can hand off to an AI coding agent to fix all reported issues automatically.

### Ami

```bash
npx -y react-native-doc@latest . --fix
# or
npx -y react-native-doc@latest . fix
```

Opens [Ami](https://ami.dev) with a pre-filled fix prompt and auto-submit enabled.

### Cline

```bash
npx -y react-native-doc@latest . --cline
# or
npx -y react-native-doc@latest . fix-cline
```

If the `cline` CLI is installed (`npm install -g cline`), runs `cline task -y` directly in the terminal with the fix prompt and working directory set. Otherwise falls back to copying the fix prompt to clipboard and opening VS Code so it can be pasted into the Cline extension.
